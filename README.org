* HIRES extraction routines

These routines extract velocity-calibrated 2D spectra of each emission line. 

We start with:

1. 2D Keck HIRES slit spectral images (FITS files). 
2. The location on the chip of the spectrograph orders (provided as a DS9 region file).
3. A wavelength calibration for the entire image (FITS image of wavelength of each pixel).
4. A list of the emission lines of interest with their rest wavelengths



** Design notes

*** Finding the orders to extract

+ We have our boxes, and then we have the calibrated pixel regions. 
+ The problem with the boxes is that they overlap
  + Possible solution: thin them down so they are just the central part of the slit in each order
