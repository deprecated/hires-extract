* HIRES extraction routines

These routines extract velocity-calibrated 2D spectra of each emission line. 

We start with:

1. 2D Keck HIRES slit spectral images (FITS files). 
2. The location on the chip of the spectrograph orders (provided as a DS9 region file).
3. A wavelength calibration for the entire image (FITS image of wavelength of each pixel).
4. A list of the emission lines of interest with their rest wavelengths
